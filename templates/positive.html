    <h1>YOU MIGH HAVE STROKE</h1>

        <h2>You have very pretty decent chance of having a stroke. But this isn't serious, it's just 
            a probability. So try taking a health examination soon.
            This model has a good accuracy of 96%, still
            this can't be a replacement for health examination.
            Maybe in future with further growth we can expect a change where machines 
            take over every filed including medical.
