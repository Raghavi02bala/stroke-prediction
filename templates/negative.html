        <h2>You have very less chance of having a stroke. But if have serious doubts it's 
            best to consider a doctor. This model has a good accuracy of 96%, still
            this can't be a replacement for health examination.
            Maybe in future with further growth we can expect a change where machines 
            take over every filed including medical.
