        <h2>Stroke Prediction</h2>
        <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">
            Stroke Prediction is my first End to End Model. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is
            the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
            This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like
            gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about
            the patient.
            This is not a replacement for actual health examination, it's just a pre check-up.
            Commonly used risk scores include the Pooled Cohort Equations8 and QRISK9–11 for CVD, as well as the
            Framingham Stroke Risk Profile12,13 for stroke. Such risk scores are typically derived using Cox
            proportional hazards models and have been validated mainly in high-income countries (HICs).14–16 However,
            the clinical utility of such models for risk prediction of stroke in contemporary populations of LMICs such
            as China is uncertain, and novel risk scores should be developed for use in such populations.17–19

            Machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly used in recent years for a variety of healthcare
            applications, and have demonstrated superior predictive value compared with traditional Cox models for
            predicting risk of stroke or overall CVD.20–23 However, these ML models have still not been widely adopted
            in clinical practice and little is known about the utility of such risk scores for prediction of stroke risk
            in a contemporary Chinese population.24

            I have focused on F1 score rather than accuracy. I just concentrated mainly on False Positives.

                Hola this is Ragavi Balasubramani.
                I'm a data Scientist, Data Analyst, Software Developer and a Writer.
                I got my intrest in data science because of my intrest in Math. To me
                this project is a small start for my great career ahead, I've always wanted
                to be a problem solver. Be someone who causes a change, and that is why I wanna
                be a entrepreneur. I actually begin as a Full Stack Developer. I worked on few prjects.
                After knowing about the whole data science wave, I got really intrested and decided to take
                it up as my domain. I learnt from the basic probability, statistics. I was always good at
                Python, so I used Python for data scince. I then learnt EDA, data collection, Data Preprocessing,
                Model Building, and a proper data analysis and storry telling using the predicted result or
                just by using the Data Analysis. I've worked both as a Software Developer and Data Anayst & Data
                Scientist.
                I have also worked in a research paper based on NLP.
                Look Down to Contact me.
